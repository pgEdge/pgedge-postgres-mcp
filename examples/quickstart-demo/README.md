# pgEdge MCP Server and AI Toolkit Quickstart

This directory contains the AI Toolkit MCP Quickstart demo.  These files are hosted on https://downloads.pgedge.com 
to support the live demo linked here: https://www.pgedge.com/ai-toolkit  

The purpose of this demo is to provide end-users a working interactive example of the MCP server in action with the 
fewest configuration steps.  Therefore, rather than building containers from the repo, it pulls the latest public 
container images from our repository.

For more detail, please refer to: [Quick Start Guide](../../docs/guide/quickstart.md)
