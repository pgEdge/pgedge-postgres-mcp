            Review this pull request following the project guidelines in .claude/CLAUDE.md.

            Focus on:
            - Code correctness and potential bugs
            - Security issues (SQL injection, auth bypasses, input validation)
            - Test coverage for new functionality
            - Code style (4-space indentation, Go best practices)
            - Documentation updates if needed

            Be constructive and specific. If changes look good, say so briefly.
