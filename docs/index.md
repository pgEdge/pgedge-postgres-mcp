## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- PostgreSQL database (any version with pg_description support)
- LLM Provider: Anthropic Claude API key, OpenAI API key, OR Ollama installation

### Quick Setup

1. **Build the server:**

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

2. **Choose your LLM provider:**

    - **Anthropic Claude**: Get API key at https://console.anthropic.com/
    - **OpenAI**: Get API key at https://platform.openai.com/
    - **Ollama**: Install from https://ollama.ai/ and download a model

3. **Configure for Claude Desktop:**

    Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):
    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
        "pgedge": {
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/bin/pgedge-pg-mcp-svr",
            "env": {
            "PGHOST": "localhost",
            "PGPORT": "5432",
            "PGDATABASE": "mydb",
            "PGUSER": "myuser",
            "PGPASSWORD": "mypass",
            "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-your-key"
            }
        }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Alternative:** Store API key in a file (more secure):

    ```bash
    # Create API key file
    echo "sk-ant-your-key" > ~/.anthropic-api-key
    chmod 600 ~/.anthropic-api-key
    ```

    Then omit `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the config - the server will read from
    `~/.anthropic-api-key` automatically.

4. **Start using:** Restart Claude Desktop and ask questions about your database!

For detailed setup instructions, see **[Configuration Guide](configuration.md)**.

## How It Works

The server operates in four main steps:

1. **Metadata Extraction** - Connects to PostgreSQL and extracts schema information (tables, columns, types, comments)
2. **Natural Language Processing** - Sends questions and schema to LLM for SQL generation
3. **Read-Only Execution** - Executes generated SQL in read-only transactions
4. **Result Formatting** - Returns formatted results to Claude Desktop

All queries via `query_database` are executed in read-only mode, preventing INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and DDL operations.

## HTTP/HTTPS Mode

Run as a standalone HTTP server:

```bash
# HTTP
./bin/pgedge-pg-mcp-svr -http

# HTTPS
./bin/pgedge-pg-mcp-svr -http -tls -cert server.crt -key server.key
```

See **[Deployment Guide](deployment.md)** and **[Authentication Guide](authentication.md)** for details.
